# Bejeweled & 2048 Game Development Project

## Project Contributors
This project is being developed by:

- **Kyla Marie Goff-Tutson**

## Project Overview
This project focuses on developing two popular puzzle games with a competitive 2-player mode:
- **Bejeweled** – A classic tile-matching puzzle game.
- **2048** – A sliding tile puzzle game where players combine numbers to reach 2048.

Each player takes turns playing for 10 seconds, and the player with the highest score at the end wins. This adds a fast-paced, competitive twist to both games!
